  summary: >
    Autonomous, driven and focused on problem solving I will challenge your needs and we will design in close collaboration the most suitable solution for your business or project.

    For me writing code is a craft and the developer a craftsman.
    This is why writing code that is clean, reviewed, maintainable and following profesional best practices to guaranty quality is a major focal point.

    As a perpetual student learning new skills is not frightening to me.
